# Notes for my portfolio websites

Set of notes that I will take during the creation of portfolio website.

## Difference between export and public keywords in Javascript/Typescript

public is a visibilty modifier - technically does nothing
private is used to set private

export means that the containing file is an external module

## Function Implementation is Missing or not immediately following the declaration

Ok, basically, I was missing the export

I would use export on the struct declaration, not necessarily just exporting the structure.

## HTML

Since I am going to build a website, I am going to need to relearn some html basics
